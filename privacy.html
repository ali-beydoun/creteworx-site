                    <p>Creteworx Concreting Services Pty Ltd (ABN: 62 682 334 783) ("we", "us", "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your personal information in accordance with the <em>Australian Privacy Act 1988</em> (Cth) and the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs).</p>

                    <p>We are a small concreting business based in Bankstown, NSW. We keep things simple and straightforward -- we do not use cookies, analytics, or any tracking technologies on this website.</p>

                    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

                    <p>We only collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us through our website contact form. The information collected includes:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Name</strong> -- so we know who we are speaking with</li>
                        <li><strong>Phone number</strong> -- so we can call you to discuss your project</li>
                        <li><strong>Email address</strong> -- so we can follow up with a quote or response</li>
                        <li><strong>Suburb</strong> -- so we can assess the project location</li>
                        <li><strong>Project type</strong> -- so we understand what service you need</li>
                        <li><strong>Message</strong> -- any additional details you choose to share about your project</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>We do not collect any information automatically. There are no cookies, no analytics tools (such as Google Analytics), and no tracking scripts on this website.</p>

                    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>

                    <p>We use the personal information you provide solely for the following purposes:</p>

                        <li>Responding to your enquiry or quote request</li>
                        <li>Contacting you to discuss your concreting project</li>

                        <li>Communicating about ongoing or completed work</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>We will never use your information for marketing, sell it to third parties, or share it with anyone outside of what is described in this policy.</p>

                    <h2>3. Third-Party Form Processing</h2>

                    <p>Our contact form uses a third-party service called <strong>FormSubmit.co</strong> to process and deliver form submissions to our email. When you submit the contact form, your information is transmitted through FormSubmit.co's servers.</p>

                    <p>FormSubmit.co acts as a data processor on our behalf. We encourage you to review <a href="https://formsubmit.co/privacy.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FormSubmit.co's privacy policy</a> for details on how they handle data in transit. We have no other third-party services processing your data on this website.</p>

                    <h2>4. Data Storage and Retention</h2>

                    <p>Your form submissions are delivered to us via email. We retain your personal information only for as long as necessary to:</p>

                    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>

                    <p>We take reasonable steps to protect your personal information from misuse, interference, loss, and unauthorised access or disclosure. Our website uses HTTPS encryption to protect data transmitted between your browser and our website.</p>

                    <p>However, as a small business, we want to be transparent: no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure. We do our best to protect your information using commercially reasonable measures.</p>
